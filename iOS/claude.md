# Claude Code Instructions for iOS Project

## Building and Running

**DO NOT** attempt to build the iOS app using command line tools like `xcodebuild`.

The user will:
- Build the app using Xcode directly
- Deploy the app to simulators or devices themselves
- Share any build outputs, errors, or logs with you as needed

## Your Role

You should focus on:
- Reading and analyzing code
- Making code modifications and improvements
- Explaining implementation details
- Suggesting architectural changes

When you need to verify changes or test functionality, inform the user and ask them to build and run the app in Xcode, then share the results with you.
